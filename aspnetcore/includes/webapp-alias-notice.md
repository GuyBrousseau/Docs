> [!NOTE]
> With the release of ASP.NET Core 2.1, `webapp` is an alias of the `razor` Razor Pages template name when creating a project with the [dotnet new](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-new) command. If executing `dotnet new webapp <OPTIONS>` doesn't result in the generation of a new Razor Pages app, install the [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-core/sdk-2.1.300).
